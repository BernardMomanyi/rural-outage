- Users table supports technician role filtering
- All required indexes are in place

### 2. **API Endpoints** ✅

- `assign_test_tickets.php` - Create and assign test tickets

## 🔧 **CURRENT ISSUE - UI Visibility**

### **Problem Identified:**
Assignment buttons only show for tickets with:
- Status = "pending" 
- No assigned technician

### **Root Cause:**
Tickets may have status other than "pending" (like "assigned", "in_progress", etc.)

### **Solution Created:**
- `check_ticket_status.php` - Diagnose current ticket states
- `reset_ticket_status.php` - Reset all tickets to pending status

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Run:** `http://localhost/rural%20outage/check_ticket_status.php`
   - See current ticket statuses
   - Identify why assignment buttons aren't showing

2. **Run:** `http://localhost/rural%20outage/reset_ticket_status.php`
   - Reset all tickets to pending status
   - Make assignment buttons visible

3. **Test:** `http://localhost/rural%20outage/admin_tickets.php`
   - Verify assignment buttons now appear
   - Test assignment functionality

### **Final Testing:**
4. **Test Admin Assignment:**
   - Login as admin
   - Go to admin_tickets.php
   - Click "Assign to Technician" on any ticket
   - Select technician and assign

5. **Test Technician View:**
   - Login as technician
   - Go to technician_tickets.php
   - Verify assigned tickets appear

## 🎯 **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

After running the reset script:
- All tickets will have status = "pending"
- Assignment buttons will be visible in admin interface
- Assignment functionality will work end-to-end
- Technicians will see their assigned tickets
